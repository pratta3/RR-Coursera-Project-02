# RR Coursera Project 02

This repository contains the code files used in the data analysis for project number 2 in the data science specialization course "Reproducible Research" on Coursera.

The project involved using the Storm Events Database from the [US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/details.jsp?type=eventtype). The database that was provided for the assignment contains data from 1950 through 2011. However, the current set of 48 unique storm events was not standardized until 1996. As such, a subset of the data containing only the entries from 1996-2011 was used for the analysis. More information about the Storm Events Database can be found at the NOAA website by clicking on the link provided above.
